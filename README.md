# PineTime

![Build PineTime Firmware](https://github.com/JF002/InfiniTime/workflows/Build%20PineTime%20Firmware/badge.svg?branch=master)

> The PineTime is a free and open source smartwatch capable of running custom-built open operating systems. Some of the notable features include a heart rate monitor, a week-long battery as well as a capacitive touch IPS display that is legible in direct sunlight. It is a fully community driven side-project, which means that it will ultimately be up to the developers and end-users to determine when they deem the PineTime ready to ship.

> We envision the PineTime as a companion for not only your PinePhone but also for your favorite devices — any phone, tablet, or even PC.

The **PineTime** smartwatch is built around the NRF52832 MCU (512KB Flash, 64KB
RAM), a 240*240 LCD display driven by the ST7789 controller, an accelerometer, a
heart rate sensor, and a vibration motor.

The goal of this project is to design an open-source firmware for the PineTime
smartwatch:

 - Code written in **modern C++**
 - Build system based on **CMake**
 - Based on **[FreeRTOS 10.0.0](https://freertos.org)** real-time OS
 - **[LittleVGL/LVGL 7](https://lvgl.io/)** as its UI library
 - **[NimBLE 1.3.0](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-nimble)** as its BLE stack

## Overview

As of now, here is the list of achievements of this project:

 - Fast and optimized LCD driver
 - BLE communication
 - Rich user interface via display, touchscreen and pushbutton
 - Time synchronization via BLE
 - Notification via BLE
 - Multiple 'apps':
    * Clock (displays date, time, battery level, BLE connection status, heart rate)
    * System info (displays BLE MAC, build date/time, uptime, version, etc.)
    * Brightness (allows the user to configure the brightness of the display)
    * Music (controls the music player on your phone)
    * Heart rate (controls the heart rate sensor and displays current rate)
    * Navigation (displays navigation instructions coming from the companion app)
    * Notification (displays the last notification received)
    * Paddle (single player pong-like game)
    * Two (2048 clone game)
 - Supported by 2 companion apps (development is in progress):
    * [Gadgetbridge](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/) (on Android)
    * [Amazfish](https://openrepos.net/content/piggz/amazfish) (on SailfishOS and Linux)
    * **[Experimental]** [WebBLEWatch](https://hubmartin.github.io/WebBLEWatch/) Synchronize time directly from your web browser: [video](https://youtu.be/IakiuhVDdrY)
 - **[Experimental]** OTA (Over-the-air) update via BLE
 - **[Experimental]** Bootloader based on [MCUBoot](https://juullabs-oss.github.io/mcuboot/)

## TODO - contribute

This project is far from being finished, and there are still a lot of things to
do for this project to become a firmware usable by the general public.

Off the top of my head, here a quick list of things to do for this project:

 - Improve BLE communication, stability, and reliability
 - Improve OTA and MCUBoot bootloader
 - Add more functions: alarm, chronometer, configuration, activities, heart rate logging, games, ...
 - Add more BLE functions: call notifications, agenda, configuration, data logging, ...
 - Measure power consumption and improve battery life
 - Improve documentation, take better pictures and videos
 - Improve the UI
 - Create companion app for multiple OSes (Linux, Android, iOS) and platforms (desktop, ARM, mobile). Do not forget the other devices from Pine64 like [the Pinephone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/) and the [Pinebook Pro](https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/).
 - Design a simple CI (preferably self-hosted and easy to reproduce)

Do not hesitate to clone/fork the code, hack on it, and create pull-requests.
I'll do my best to review and merge them :)

## Credits
I’m not working alone on this project. First, many people create pull requests
for this project. Then, there is the whole #pinetime community: a lot of people
all around the world who are hacking, searching, experimenting and programming
the PineTime. We exchange our ideas, experiments and code in the chat rooms and
forums.

Here are some people I would like to highlight:

 - [Atc1441](https://github.com/atc1441/): He works on an Arduino based firmware
 for the PineTime and many other smartwatches based on similar hardware. He was
 of great help when I was implementing support for the BMA421 motion sensor and
 I²C driver.
 - [Koen](https://github.com/bosmoment): He’s working on a firmware based on
 RiotOS. He integrated similar libs as me: NimBLE, LittleVGL, ... his help was
 invaluable too!
 - [Lup Yuen Lee](https://github.com/lupyuen): He is everywhere: he works on a
 Rust firmware, builds a MCUBoot based bootloader for the PineTime, designs a
 Flutter based companion app for smartphones and writes a lot of articles about
 the PineTime!
